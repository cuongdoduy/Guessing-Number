# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game where the player tries to guess a random number chosen by the computer. The game provides feedback to the player, indicating whether their guess is too high or too low. After the player successfully guesses the number, the game displays the number of attempts it took and calculates statistics based on the attempts made.

## Instructions
* When the program starts, an intro/welcome message is displayed to the player.
* A random number is generated and stored as the solution.
* The player is continuously prompted to enter a guess.
    * If the guess is greater than the solution, the game displays "It's lower" to the player.
    * If the guess is less than the solution, the game displays "It's higher" to the player.
* Once the player guesses the correct number, the game stops looping and displays "Got it" to the player, along with the number of attempts it took to guess the correct number.
* The attempt number is saved to a list.
* At the end of the game, the player is shown:
* The number of attempts made.
* The mean, median, and mode of the saved attempts list.
* The best score achieved so far.
* The player is asked if they want to play again.
